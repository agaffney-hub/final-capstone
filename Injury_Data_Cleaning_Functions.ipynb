    "- PlayKey will be used as the Key to merge the datasets, so PlayerKey and GameID can be removed. While FieldType information is also in the surface column of the injuries table, we need to maintain it here, so we don't lose the data from the columns not containing injuries. \n",

    "- Games played in retractable roof stadiums with Open Domes are Outdoor, Closed Domes are Indoor\n",
    "- Weather - there are 63 unique types of weather.... this is odd\n",
